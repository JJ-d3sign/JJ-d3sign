The program starts of by asking the user to input their student details to login. It then asks the user to enter which section they would like to view. There are 5 catgories 
which the user can view. They are "Attendance","Peformance","Notes","Syllabus" and "Announcements". By selecting "Attendance" the user can view his/her aatendance out of the
total number of days of college also displaying their attendance in percentage which can help them to keep in mind the minimum number of days they are required to attend.
 Under "Performance" the user is able to view their record of all the past papers categorized subject-wise which would help them to keep in mind which subjects they should put an extra effort in 
and reorganize their study plan to help them do well overall. Through "Notes" the user is able to view all important points mentioned by the teachers for their respective subject
along with a few video links recommended by teachers to help students clear up any troubles in a subject. If they select "Syllabus" they are able to view the syllabus for
 any upcoming exams a month prior. By choosing the "Announcements" section the user is able to view announcements posted by the school. The user is also able to view a list
 of all holidays as well as events and competitions planned for the year.

I believe that this would be a really app as it would be helpful for students considering that this would be easier to maintain with all the needed information stored under specific sections.
